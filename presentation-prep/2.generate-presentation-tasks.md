# Rule: Generating Presentation Preparation Tasks from a Presentation Outline

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step presentation preparation task list based on an existing Presentation Outline Document.

## Process

1.  **Receive Presentation Outline Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific presentation outline file.
2.  **Analyze Presentation Outline:** The AI reads and analyzes the presentation structure, key messages, visual requirements, and presentation delivery needs.
3.  **Assess Current Preparation State:** Review existing slides, presentation materials, or practice recordings.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Presentation Tasks:** Based on the outline analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level presentation preparation tasks required to create and deliver an effective conference presentation.
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Present the high-level tasks to the user and wait for "Go" to proceed.
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Presentation Sub-Tasks:** Once confirmed, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary for presentation development and delivery.
7.  **Identify Relevant Presentation Files:** Based on the tasks and presentation outline, identify potential slide files, visual materials, and practice tools needed.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and preparation notes into the final Markdown structure.

## Output Format

The generated presentation preparation task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Presentation Preparation Files

- `slides/presentation-slides.md` - Main presentation slides with content and visualizations.
- `handouts/summary.pdf` - Supplementary materials for audience distribution.
- `practice/script.md` - Speaker notes and talking points.
- `visualizations/figures/` - Directory for presentation visual aids.
- `materials/references.bib` - Bibliography and reference materials.
- `submission/abstract.md` - Conference abstract submission.

### Notes

- Presentation files should support effective communication of research findings.
- Include timing notes and transition points for smooth delivery.
