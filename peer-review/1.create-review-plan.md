# Rule: Creating a Peer Review Plan for Academic Manuscripts

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive peer review plan in Markdown format, based on manuscript submissions, journal requirements, or review requests.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a manuscript, review request, or description of a paper that needs to be reviewed. The plan should provide a structured approach for conducting thorough and constructive peer reviews.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are common areas to explore for peer review:

*   **Journal/Conference:** "Which journal or conference is this review for?"
*   **Manuscript Type:** "What type of manuscript is this (e.g., research article, review paper, methodology paper)?"
*   **Review Type:** "Is this a single-blind, double-blind, or open review?"
*   **Review Criteria:** "What are the specific review criteria or guidelines provided by the journal?"
*   **Reviewer Expertise:** "What is your specific expertise relevant to this manuscript?"
*   **Timeline:** "What is the deadline for completing this review?"
*   **Review Format:** "What format should the review follow (e.g., structured form, narrative comments, rating scales)?"
*   **Confidentiality Requirements:** "Are there specific confidentiality or ethical requirements for this review?"
*   **Confidentiality Period:** "How long do you need to maintain confidentiality?"
*   **Conflicts of Interest:** "Are there any conflicts of interest that need to be disclosed?"
*   **Previous Reviews:** "Are there previous reviews or author responses that need to be considered?"
*   **Review Scope:** "What aspects of the manuscript should be the focus of the review?"
*   **Recommendation Options:** "What recommendation options are available (e.g., accept, minor revisions, major revisions, reject)?"
*   **Specific Concerns:** "Are there particular areas of the manuscript that need special attention?"

## Peer Review Plan Structure

The generated peer review plan should include the following sections:

1.  **Review Overview:** Basic information about the manuscript, authors, and review context.
2.  **Review Criteria & Evaluation:** Specific criteria for evaluating the manuscript's quality and contribution.
3.  **Review Structure:** Organization of the review comments and recommendations.
4.  **Timeline & Deadlines:** Schedule for completing different review tasks.
5.  **Confidentiality & Ethics:** Protocols for maintaining confidentiality and ethical standards.
6.  **Review Deliverables:** Specific outputs and comments to be provided.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the peer review plan is a **researcher, academic, or journal reviewer** responsible for evaluating academic manuscripts. Therefore, the plan should follow standard peer review practices and journal-specific requirements.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `/peer-review/`
*   **Filename:** `[n]-plan-[manuscript-topic].md` (Where `n` is a zero-padded 4-digit sequence starting from 0001, e.g., `0001-plan-machine-learning-applications.md`, `0002-plan-systematic-review-healthcare.md`, etc.)

## Peer Review Standards

- Follow journal-specific review guidelines and criteria
- Maintain objectivity and constructive criticism
- Ensure confidentiality of the review process
- Provide specific, actionable feedback for improvement
