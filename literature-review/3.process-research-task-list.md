# Literature Review Task List Management

Guidelines for managing literature review task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a literature review

## Literature Review Task Implementation
- **One literature review sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next literature review sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **literature review sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** literature review subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Validate the literature review work completed (check search strategies, verify inclusion/exclusion criteria, ensure proper citation format, etc.)
    - **Only if all literature review validation passes**: Organize literature review materials and update documentation
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary literature notes and organize final files
    - **Document Progress**: Use a descriptive literature review progress update that:
      - Uses academic writing format
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent literature review task
    - Lists key literature findings, synthesis results, or writing progress
    - References the literature review task number and literature review context
  3. Once all the literature review subtasks are marked completed and work has been organized, mark the **parent literature review task** as completed.
- Stop after each literature review sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Literature Review Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the literature review task list as you work:**
   - Mark literature review tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new literature review tasks as they emerge during the literature review process.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Literature Review Files" section:**
   - List every literature review file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its literature review purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with literature review task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the literature review task list file after finishing any significant literature review work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **literature review sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent literature review task** `[x]` once **all** its literature review subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered literature review tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Literature Review Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting literature review work, check which literature review sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a literature review sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.

## Literature Review-Specific Considerations

- **Search Strategy Tasks:** Include database selection, search string development, and search execution.
- **Screening Tasks:** Follow systematic review methodology for title/abstract and full-text screening.
- **Data Extraction Tasks:** Use standardized data extraction forms and ensure consistency.
- **Synthesis Tasks:** Ensure appropriate synthesis methods (narrative, thematic, meta-analysis).
- **Validation:** Check for systematic approach, proper documentation of search process, and adherence to literature review standards.
- **Documentation:** Maintain proper literature review documentation for transparency and reproducibility.

## Literature Review Quality Assurance

- **Search Documentation:** Record search dates, databases, and search strings used.
- **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:** Ensure clear documentation of criteria application.
- **Citation Management:** Verify proper citation format and complete reference lists.
- **Synthesis Rigor:** Ensure findings are properly synthesized and conclusions are supported by evidence.
