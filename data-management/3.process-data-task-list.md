# Research Data Management Task List Management

Guidelines for managing research data management task lists in markdown files to track progress on implementing comprehensive data management practices throughout the research lifecycle.

## Data Management Task Implementation
- **One data management sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next data management sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"

## Completion Protocol

1. When you finish a **data management sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
2. If **all** data management subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Validate the data management work completed (check compliance with funder requirements, verify metadata standards, ensure data security measures, etc.)
    - **Only if all data management validation passes**: Organize data management materials and update documentation
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary data management notes and organize final files
    - **Document Progress**: Use a descriptive data management progress update that:
      - Uses professional data management language
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent data management task
    - Lists key data management achievements, documentation completions, or infrastructure improvements
    - References the data management task number and research context
3. Stop after each data management sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Data Management Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the data management task list as you work:**
   - Mark data management tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new data management tasks as they emerge during the data management implementation process.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Data Management Files" section:**
   - List every data management file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its data management purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with data management task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the data management task list file after finishing any significant data management work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **data management sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent data management task** `[x]` once **all** its data management subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered data management tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Data Management Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting data management work, check which data management sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a data management sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.

## Data Management-Specific Considerations

- **Documentation Tasks:** Include creating metadata templates, data dictionaries, and README files.
- **Storage & Backup Tasks:** Ensure implementation of secure storage solutions and regular backup procedures.
- **Compliance Tasks:** Address funder requirements, institutional policies, and ethical standards.
- **Validation:** Check for compliance with data management standards, proper security measures, and adherence to preservation requirements.
- **Professional Standards:** Maintain appropriate data management terminology, follow best practices, and ensure regulatory compliance.
- **Infrastructure Setup:** Include configuration of data repositories, access control systems, and version control practices.

## Data Management Workflow

- **Data Collection Phase:** Implement data collection protocols and initial documentation.
- **Data Processing Phase:** Set up data cleaning, transformation, and analysis workflows.
- **Data Sharing Phase:** Prepare data for sharing, including anonymization if needed, and repository submission.
- **Long-term Preservation:** Ensure data is properly preserved with appropriate metadata for future reuse.

## Quality Assurance

- **Data Integrity:** Verify data quality and consistency throughout the management process.
- **Metadata Quality:** Ensure metadata is complete, accurate, and follows disciplinary standards.
- **Security Measures:** Implement appropriate data security protocols for sensitive information.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure data remains accessible to authorized users while protecting privacy and confidentiality.
