# Rule: Generating a Thesis/Dissertation Writing Task List from a Thesis Outline

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step thesis writing task list in Markdown format based on an existing Thesis Outline Document. The task list should guide a graduate student through the systematic implementation of their thesis writing project.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/thesis-writing/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[thesis-outline-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-0001-outline-machine-learning-applications.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive Thesis Outline Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific thesis outline file
2.  **Analyze Thesis Outline Document:** The AI reads and analyzes the thesis structure, chapters, key points, and writing requirements.
3.  **Assess Current Thesis Writing State:** Review any existing chapter drafts, literature reviews, or research materials to understand current progress and available content.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Thesis Writing Tasks:** Based on the outline analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level thesis writing tasks required to complete the thesis. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about five tasks. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level thesis writing tasks based on the outline. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Thesis Writing Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task, cover the writing details implied by the outline, and consider existing writing materials where relevant without being constrained by them.
7.  **Identify Relevant Thesis Writing Files:** Based on the tasks and outline, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Thesis Writing Files` section, including corresponding chapter drafts, figures, or data files if applicable.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
9.  **Save Thesis Writing Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/thesis-writing/` directory with the filename `tasks-[thesis-outline-file-name].md`, where `[thesis-outline-file-name]` matches the base name of the input thesis outline file (e.g., if the input was `0001-outline-machine-learning-applications.md`, the output is `tasks-0001-outline-machine-learning-applications.md`).

## Output Format

The generated thesis writing task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Thesis Writing Files

- `chapters/introduction.md` - Draft of the introduction chapter).
- `chapters/literature-review.md` - Draft of the literature review chapter).
- `figures/results-charts/` - Generated figures and visualizations for results chapters).
- `data/analysis/` - Data analysis scripts and results).
- `references/bibliography.bib` - Bibliography file with all references).
- `appendices/` - Supplementary materials and data).

### Notes

- Chapter drafts should be organized by thesis structure.
- Figures and tables should be properly labeled and referenced.
- Use appropriate academic writing tools (e.g., LaTeX, Word with reference managers).

## Thesis Writing Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Thesis Writing Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Thesis writing sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Thesis writing sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Thesis Writing Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Thesis writing sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Thesis Writing Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely organizational or preparatory)
```

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed thesis writing sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level thesis writing plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the thesis writing task list is a **graduate student or researcher** who will implement the thesis writing project with awareness of academic standards and institutional requirements.

## Final Instructions

- Ensure tasks are specific, measurable, and actionable for thesis/dissertation writing.
- Consider the research methodology and chapter requirements when breaking down tasks.
- Include tasks for chapter drafting, literature synthesis, data analysis, and final formatting.
- Adapt the task breakdown based on the complexity and scope of the thesis project.
- Include tasks for committee communication, defense preparation, and institutional submission requirements.
- Consider the specific formatting requirements (e.g., line spacing, margins, font) when creating file references.
