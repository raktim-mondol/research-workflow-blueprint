# Research Task List Management

Guidelines for managing research task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a research proposal

## Research Task Implementation
- **One research sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next research sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **research sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** research subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Validate the research work completed (check literature sources, verify methodology, ensure proper citation format, etc.)
    - **Only if all research validation passes**: Organize research materials and update documentation
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary research notes and organize final files
    - **Document Progress**: Use a descriptive research progress update that:
      - Uses academic writing format
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent research task
    - Lists key literature findings, data analysis results, or writing progress
    - References the research task number and proposal context
  3. Once all the research subtasks are marked completed and work has been organized, mark the **parent research task** as completed.
- Stop after each research sub‑task and wait for the user's s go‑ahead.

## Research Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the research task list as you work:**
   - Mark research tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new research tasks as they emerge during the research process.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Research Files" section:**
   - List every research file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its research purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with research task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the research task list file after finishing any significant research work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **research sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent research task** `[x]` once **all** its research subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered research tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Research Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting research work, check which research sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a research sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.

## Research-Specific Considerations

- **Literature Review Tasks:** Include systematic search, screening, data extraction, and synthesis.
- **Data Analysis Tasks:** Follow appropriate research methodology and statistical standards.
- **Writing Tasks:** Ensure academic tone, proper citation format, and logical flow.
- **Validation:** Check for academic rigor, proper methodology, and adherence to research standards.
- **Documentation:** Maintain proper research documentation for reproducibility.
- **Citation Management:** Ensure all sources are properly cited and referenced.
