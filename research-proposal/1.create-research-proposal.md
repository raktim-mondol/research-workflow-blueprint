# Rule: Generating a Research Proposal Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed Research Proposal Document in Markdown format, based on an initial user prompt. The proposal should be clear, actionable, and suitable for guiding academic research and literature reviews.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a brief description or request for a new research topic or literature review.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before writing the proposal, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to gather sufficient detail. The goal is to understand the research question, objectives, and methodology.
3.  **Generate Research Proposal:** Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a research proposal using the structure outlined below.
4.  **Save Research Proposal:** Save the generated document as `[n]-proposal-[research-topic].md` inside the `/research` directory. (Where `n` is a zero-padded 4-digit sequence starting from 0001, e.g., `0001-proposal-machine-learning-applications.md`, `0002-proposal-systematic-review-healthcare.md`, etc.)

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are some common areas to explore for academic research:

*   **Research Question:** "What is the specific research question you want to address?" or "What gap in the literature does this research aim to fill?"
*   **Objectives:** "What are the main objectives of this research project?"
*   **Scope:** "What is the scope of your literature review or research?"
*   **Methodology:** "What research methodology do you plan to use (e.g., systematic review, meta-analysis, empirical study)?"
*   **Key Concepts:** "What are the key concepts, theories, or frameworks relevant to this research?"
*   **Literature Sources:** "What databases or sources will you use for literature search (e.g., PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar)?"
*   **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:** "What criteria will you use to include or exclude studies?"
*   **Expected Outcomes:** "What are the expected outcomes or contributions of this research?"
*   **Timeline:** "Do you have a timeline or deadlines for this research?"
*   **Audience:** "Who is the target audience for this research (e.g., academic community, practitioners, policymakers)?"
*   **Ethical Considerations:** "Are there any ethical considerations or approvals needed?"
*   **Resources Needed:** "What resources (e.g., software, access to databases) are required?"

## Research Proposal Structure

The generated research proposal should include the following sections:

1.  **Title:** A clear and concise title for the research project.
2.  **Introduction/Background:** Provide context, problem statement, and rationale for the research.
3.  **Research Questions:** State the main research question and any sub-questions.
4.  **Objectives:** List the specific, measurable objectives for this research.
5.  **Literature Review Scope:** Define the scope of the literature review, including key terms and databases.
4.  **Methodology:** Describe the research methods, data collection, analysis techniques, and any tools to be used.
5.  **Expected Outcomes:** Describe the anticipated results, contributions to knowledge, or practical implications.
6.  **Timeline:** Outline the proposed timeline for completing the research.
7.  **Resources Required:** List any software, databases, or other resources needed.
8.  **Ethical Considerations:** Mention any ethical issues and how they will be addressed.
9.  **References (Optional):** Include any initial key references if provided.
10. **Open Questions:** List any remaining questions or areas needing further clarification.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the research proposal is a **researcher or student**. Therefore, the proposal should be academic in tone, well-structured, and follow standard research proposal formats.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `/research/`
*   **Filename:** `[n]-proposal-[research-topic].md`

## Final instructions

1. Do NOT start implementing the research tasks yet.
2. Make sure to ask the user clarifying questions.
3. Take the user's answers to the clarifying questions and improve the research proposal.
