# Rule: Generating a Research Ethics & Compliance Task List from an Ethics Plan

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step ethics and compliance task list in Markdown format based on an existing Ethics Plan Document. The task list should guide a researcher through the systematic implementation of their ethics and compliance strategy.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/research-ethics/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[ethics-plan-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-climate-change-ethics-plan.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive Ethics Plan Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific ethics and compliance plan file
2.  **Analyze Ethics Plan Document:** The AI reads and analyzes the ethics structure, requirements, policies, and implementation details.
3.  **Assess Current Ethics Compliance State:** Review any existing ethics approvals, compliance documentation, or training records to understand current progress and requirements.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Ethics Tasks:** Based on the plan analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level ethics and compliance tasks required to implement the plan. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about five tasks. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level ethics and compliance tasks based on the plan. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Ethics Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task, cover the compliance details implied by the plan, and consider existing ethics infrastructure where relevant without being constrained by it.
7.  **Identify Relevant Ethics Files:** Based on the tasks and plan, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Ethics Files` section, including corresponding documentation, compliance forms, or training materials if applicable.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
9.  **Save Ethics Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/research-ethics/` directory with the filename `tasks-[ethics-plan-file-name].md`, where `[ethics-plan-file-name]` matches the base name of the input ethics plan file (e.g., if the input was `climate-change-ethics-plan.md`, the output is `tasks-climate-change-ethics-plan.md`).

## Output Format

The generated ethics and compliance task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Ethics Files

- `ethics-compliance-plan.md` - Complete ethics and compliance plan document.
- `irb-approvals/` - Institutional review board approval documents.
- `informed-consent/` - Consent forms and participant information sheets.
- `risk-assessment-documents/` - Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation plans.
- `compliance-monitoring/` - Ongoing compliance monitoring records and reports.
- `ethics-training-records/` - Documentation of required ethics training and certifications.

### Notes

- Ethics documentation should follow institutional policies and regulatory requirements.
- Compliance measures should address participant protection, data security, and regulatory adherence.
- Use appropriate ethics frameworks and compliance tools (e.g., IRB submission systems, data protection impact assessments, etc.).
