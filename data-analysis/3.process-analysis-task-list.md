# Data Analysis Task List Management

Guidelines for managing data analysis task lists to ensure systematic, reproducible, and valid analytical procedures.

## Data Analysis Task Implementation
- **One data analysis sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until user approval.

## Completion Protocol

1.  **Sub-task Completion:** When finishing a data analysis sub‑task, immediately mark it as completed (`[x]`).
2.  **Parent Task Completion:** When **all** subtasks under a parent task are `[x]`:
    - **Validation:** Check analytical procedures, verify statistical assumptions, and ensure result interpretability.
    - **Only if validation passes:** Organize analysis materials and update documentation.
    - **Clean up:** Remove temporary analysis files and organize final analysis outputs.
    - **Document Progress:** Use descriptive analysis progress updates that:
      - Document analytical procedures and outcomes.
      - Summarize key analytical findings and insights.
      - Reference the data analysis task number and research context.
3.  **Parent Task Marking:** Once all subtasks are completed and organized, mark the parent task as completed.

## Data Analysis Task List Maintenance

1.  **Regular Updates:** Update the data analysis task list after significant analytical work.
2.  **File Maintenance:** Keep "Relevant Data Analysis Files" accurate and current.

## AI Instructions

When working with data analysis task lists, the AI must:

1.  Follow the completion protocol for each sub-task and parent task.
2.  **Add New Tasks:** Incorporate newly identified analytical procedures as they emerge.

## Data Analysis-Specific Considerations

- **Statistical Rigor:** Ensure appropriate statistical methods are applied and assumptions are checked.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensure all analysis steps can be reproduced with the provided data and scripts.

## Analysis Quality Assurance

- **Methodological Soundness:** Verify analytical approaches are appropriate for the research questions and data characteristics.
- **Result Validation:** Include procedures for verifying analysis accuracy and reliability.
- **Documentation Completeness:** Ensure all analytical procedures are properly documented.

## Data Analysis Guidelines

- **Transparency:** Document all analytical decisions and procedures.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Include checks for result robustness to analytical choices.
- **Interpretation Framework:** Ensure analysis results are properly interpreted in the context of the research objectives.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Optimize analysis procedures for computational performance.
- **Error Handling:** Include procedures for identifying and addressing analytical errors or anomalies.

## Technical Standards

- **Code Quality:** Ensure analysis scripts are well-documented and follow programming best practices.
- **Data Security:** Implement appropriate measures for protecting sensitive data.

## Output Management

- **Figure Generation:** Ensure all visualizations are properly labeled and referenced.
- **Table Creation:** Generate clear, informative tables summarizing key results.
- **Report Generation:** Create comprehensive analysis reports that clearly communicate findings and limitations.
