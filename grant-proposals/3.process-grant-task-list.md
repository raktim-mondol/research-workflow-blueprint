# Grant Writing Task List Management

Guidelines for managing grant writing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a grant proposal for funding submission.

## Grant Writing Task Implementation
- **One grant writing sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next grant writing sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **grant writing sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** grant writing subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Validate the grant writing work completed (check funding agency guidelines, verify budget calculations, ensure proper formatting, etc.)
    - **Only if all grant writing validation passes**: Organize grant writing materials and update documentation
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary grant writing notes and organize final files
    - **Document Progress**: Use a descriptive grant writing progress update that:
      - Uses professional grant writing format
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent grant writing task
    - Lists key proposal sections completed, budget components finalized, or supporting documents prepared
    - References the grant writing task number and proposal context
  3. Once all the grant writing subtasks are marked completed and work has been organized, mark the **parent grant writing task** as completed.
- Stop after each grant writing sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Grant Writing Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the grant writing task list as you work:**
   - Mark grant writing tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new grant writing tasks as they emerge during the grant writing process.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Grant Writing Files" section:**
   - List every grant writing file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its grant writing purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with grant writing task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the grant writing task list file after finishing any significant grant writing work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **grant writing sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent grant writing task** `[x]` once **all** its grant writing subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered grant writing tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Grant Writing Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting grant writing work, check which grant writing sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a grant writing sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.

## Grant Writing-Specific Considerations

- **Proposal Section Writing Tasks:** Include drafting, revising, and polishing each grant proposal section.
- **Budget Development Tasks:** Ensure accurate cost calculations and proper justification.
- **Supporting Document Preparation:** Follow funding agency requirements for CVs, letters, and other supporting materials.
- **Format Compliance:** Check that all documents meet agency formatting and submission requirements.
- **Validation:** Verify alignment with funding priorities, methodological soundness, and feasibility.
- **Documentation:** Maintain proper grant writing documentation for version control and collaboration.

## Grant Writing Quality Assurance

- **Agency Compliance:** Ensure proposal follows all specific requirements of the funding agency.
- **Budget Accuracy:** Verify all cost calculations and budget justifications.
- **Submission Preparation:** Include tasks for final formatting, proofreading, and preparing complete submission package.
- **Language Quality:** Check for professional tone, clarity of expression, and persuasive argumentation.
- **Argument Coherence:** Ensure logical flow between sections and compelling case for funding.

## Grant Writing Process Guidelines

- **Drafting Phase:** Focus on developing compelling narrative and strong justification.
- **Revision Phase:** Improve clarity, coherence, and alignment with funding priorities.
- **Final Review:** Include comprehensive proofreading and quality checks before submission.
- **Submission Checklist:** Ensure all required forms, certifications, and supporting documents are included.
- **Post-Submission Planning:** Include tasks for follow-up communication and potential revisions.
