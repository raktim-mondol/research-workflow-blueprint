# Research Ethics & Compliance Task List Management

Guidelines for managing research ethics and compliance task lists in markdown files to track progress on implementing comprehensive ethics practices throughout the research lifecycle.

## Ethics Task Implementation
- **One ethics sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next ethics sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"

## Completion Protocol

1. When you finish an **ethics sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`

## Ethics Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the ethics task list as you work:**
   - Mark ethics tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
2. When **all** ethics subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Validate the ethics work completed (check compliance with regulations, verify consent procedures, ensure participant protection measures, etc.)
    - **Only if all ethics validation passes**: Organize ethics materials and update compliance documentation
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary ethics notes and organize final files
    - **Document Progress**: Use a descriptive ethics progress update that:
      - Uses professional ethics and compliance language
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent ethics task
    - Lists key ethics achievements, compliance completions, or participant protection improvements
    - References the ethics task number and research context
3. Stop after each ethics sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## AI Instructions

When working with ethics task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the ethics task list file after finishing any significant ethics work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **ethics sub‑task** `[x]`
   - Mark the **parent ethics task** `[x]` once **all** its ethics subtasks are `[x]`
3. Add newly discovered ethics tasks as they emerge during the ethics implementation process.
4. Maintain the "Relevant Ethics Files" section:
   - List every ethics file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its ethics purpose.
5. Before starting ethics work, check which ethics sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing an ethics sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.

## Ethics-Specific Considerations

- **IRB Approval Tasks:** Include preparing IRB applications, consent forms, and participant recruitment materials.
- **Risk Management Tasks:** Ensure implementation of risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and emergency procedures.
- **Compliance Documentation Tasks:** Address regulatory requirements, institutional policies, and ethical standards.
- **Validation:** Check for compliance with ethics frameworks, proper participant protection measures, and
- **Documentation Tasks:** Include creating ethics training records, compliance monitoring reports, and audit trails.
- **Monitoring & Reporting:** Include ongoing compliance monitoring, incident reporting, and documentation updates.
- **Training Requirements:** Ensure all research team members complete required ethics training and certifications.
- **Data Protection Tasks:** Implement appropriate data security measures, confidentiality protocols, and privacy safeguards.
