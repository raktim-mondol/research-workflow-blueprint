# Thesis/Dissertation Writing Task List Management

Guidelines for managing thesis/dissertation writing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing an academic thesis or dissertation for degree completion.

## Thesis Writing Task Implementation
- **One thesis writing sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next thesis writing sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **thesis writing sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** thesis writing subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Validate the thesis writing work completed (check academic tone, verify citation format, ensure logical flow, etc.)
    - **Only if all thesis writing validation passes**: Organize thesis writing materials and update documentation
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary thesis writing notes and organize final files
    - **Document Progress**: Use a descriptive thesis writing progress update that:
      - Uses academic writing format
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent thesis writing task
    - Lists key chapter completions, literature synthesis achievements, or data analysis progress
    - References the thesis writing task number and thesis context
  3. Once all the thesis writing subtasks are marked completed and work has been organized, mark the **parent thesis writing task** as completed.
- Stop after each thesis writing sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Thesis Writing Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the thesis writing task list as you work:**
   - Mark thesis writing tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new thesis writing tasks as they emerge during the thesis writing process.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Thesis Writing Files" section:**
   - List every thesis writing file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its thesis writing purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with thesis writing task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the thesis writing task list file after finishing any significant thesis writing work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **thesis writing sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent thesis writing task** `[x]` once **all** its thesis writing subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered thesis writing tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Thesis Writing Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting thesis writing work, check which thesis writing sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a thesis writing sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
