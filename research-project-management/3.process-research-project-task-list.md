# Research Project Management Task List Management

Guidelines for managing research project management task lists to coordinate the complete research lifecycle.

## Project Management Task Implementation
- **One project management sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until user approval.

## Completion Protocol

1.  **Sub-task Completion:** When finishing a project management sub‑task, immediately mark it as completed (`[x]`).
2.  **Parent Task Completion:** When **all** subtasks under a parent task are `[x]`:
    - **Validation:** Check coordination effectiveness, communication clarity, and progress tracking accuracy.
    - **Only if validation passes:** Organize project management materials and update coordination documentation.
    - **Clean up:** Remove temporary coordination notes and organize final project management files.
    - **Document Progress:** Use descriptive project management updates that:
      - Document coordination activities and outcomes.
      - Summarize project management achievements.
      - Reference the project management task number and project context.
3.  **Parent Task Marking:** Once all subtasks are completed and organized, mark the parent task as completed.

## Project Management Task List Maintenance

1.  **Regular Updates:** Update the project management task list after significant coordination work.
2.  **File Maintenance:** Keep "Relevant Research Project Management Files" accurate and current.

## AI Instructions

When working with research project management task lists, the AI must:

1.  Follow the completion protocol for each sub-task and parent task.
2.  **Add New Tasks:** Incorporate newly identified coordination needs as they emerge.
3.  **Coordination Focus:** Ensure all tasks support effective coordination across research components.

## Project Management-Specific Considerations

- **Interdependency Management:** Track and coordinate dependencies between different research activities.
- **Progress Assessment:** Implement regular progress reviews and milestone assessments.
- **Risk Management:** Include tasks for ongoing risk assessment and mitigation.
- **Communication Management:** Ensure clear and effective team communication.
- **Resource Optimization:** Monitor and optimize resource allocation across the project.
- **Quality Control:** Maintain research quality standards while managing project coordination.

## Coordination Quality Assurance

- **Communication Effectiveness:** Verify team coordination and information sharing.
- **Progress Tracking Accuracy:** Ensure project progress is accurately documented and communicated.
- **Stakeholder Management:** Coordinate communication with all project stakeholders.
- **Timeline Management:** Monitor project schedule and identify potential delays early.
- **Resource Utilization:** Monitor resource allocation and identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Documentation Completeness:** Ensure all coordination activities are properly documented.

## Project Management Guidelines

- **Strategic Planning:** Align project activities with overall research objectives.
- **Adaptive Management:** Include mechanisms for course correction based on progress assessments.
- **Integration Management:** Ensure smooth coordination between literature review, data analysis, and paper writing.
- **Contingency Planning:** Develop and implement backup plans for critical project components.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track project performance against established milestones and success criteria.
