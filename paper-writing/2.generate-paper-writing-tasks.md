# Rule: Generating a Paper Writing Task List from a Paper Outline

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step paper writing task list in Markdown format based on an existing Paper Outline Document. The task list should guide a writer through the systematic implementation of their paper writing project.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/paper-writing/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[paper-outline-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-0001-outline-machine-learning-applications.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive Paper Outline Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific paper outline file
2.  **Analyze Paper Outline Document:** The AI reads and analyzes the paper structure, sections, key points, and writing requirements.
3.  **Assess Current Writing State:** Review any existing drafts, sections, or writing materials to understand current progress and available content.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Paper Writing Tasks:** Based on the paper outline analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level paper writing tasks required to complete the paper. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about five tasks. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level paper writing tasks based on the paper outline. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Paper Writing Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task, cover the writing details implied by the outline, and consider existing writing materials where relevant without being constrained by them.
7.  **Identify Relevant Paper Writing Files:** Based on the tasks and paper outline, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Paper Writing Files` section, including corresponding drafts, figures, or data files if applicable.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
9.  **Save Paper Writing Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/paper-writing/` directory with the filename `tasks-[paper-outline-file-name].md`, where `[paper-outline-file-name]` matches the base name of the input paper outline file (e.g., if the input was `0001-outline-machine-learning-applications.md`, the output is `tasks-0001-outline-machine-learning-applications.md`).

## Output Format

The generated paper writing task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Paper Writing Files

- `drafts/introduction.md` - Draft of the introduction section).
- `drafts/methods.md` - Draft of the methodology section).
- `figures/result-chart.png` - Generated figures and visualizations).
- `data/analysis-results.csv` - Data analysis results).
- `references/bibliography.bib` - Bibliography file with all references).
- `submission/cover-letter.md` - Cover letter for submission).

### Notes

- Writing drafts should be organized by paper sections.
- Figures and tables should be properly labeled and referenced.
- Use appropriate academic writing tools (e.g., LaTeX, Word with reference managers).
