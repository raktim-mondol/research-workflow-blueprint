# Rule: Generating a Peer Review Task List from a Review Plan

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step peer review task list in Markdown format based on an existing Peer Review Plan Document. The task list should guide a reviewer through the systematic implementation of their peer review project.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/peer-review/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[review-plan-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-0001-plan-machine-learning-applications.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive Review Plan Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific peer review plan file
2.  **Analyze Review Plan Document:** The AI reads and analyzes the review criteria, structure, timeline, and other sections of the specified review plan.
3.  **Assess Current Review State:** Review any existing review notes, comments, or evaluation materials to understand current progress and available resources.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Review Tasks:** Based on the plan analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level review tasks required to complete the review. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about five tasks. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level peer review tasks based on the review plan. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Review Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasksks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task, cover the review details implied by the plan, and consider existing review resources where relevant without being constrained by them.
7.  **Identify Relevant Review Files:** Based on the tasks and plan, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Review Files` section, including corresponding review comments or evaluation notes if applicable.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
9.  **Save Review Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/peer-review/` directory with the filename `tasks-[review-plan-file-name].md`, where `[review-plan-file-name]` matches the base name of the input review plan file (e.g., if the input was `0001-plan-machine-learning-applications.md`, the output is `tasks-0001-plan-machine-learning-applications.md`).

## Output Format

The generated peer review task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Review Files

- `review-notes/major-comments.md` - Major comments and recommendations).
- `review-notes/minor-comments.md` - Minor comments and suggestions).

### Notes

- Review comments should be organized by manuscript sections.
- Evaluation criteria should be clearly defined and consistently applied.

## Peer Review Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Review Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Review sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Review sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Review Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Review sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Review Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely organizational or preparatory)
```

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed review sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level review plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the peer review task list is a **researcher, academic, or journal reviewer** who will implement the peer review project with awareness of academic standards and journal requirements.

## Final Instructions

- Ensure tasks are specific, measurable, and actionable for peer review implementation.
- Consider the specific requirements of the journal or conference when breaking down tasks.
- Include tasks for manuscript evaluation, comment preparation, and recommendation formulation.
- Adapt the task breakdown based on the complexity and scope of the review project.
- Include tasks for maintaining confidentiality, providing constructive feedback, and following ethical guidelines.
- Consider the review format (e.g., structured form, narrative comments) when creating file references.
