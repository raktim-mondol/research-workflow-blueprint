# Rule: Generating a Literature Review Task List from a Literature Review Document

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step literature review task list in Markdown format based on an existing Literature Review Document. The task list should guide a researcher through the systematic implementation of their literature review project.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/literature-review/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[literature-review-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-0001-conduct-literature-review.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive Literature Review Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific literature review file
2.  **Analyze Literature Review Document:** The AI reads and analyzes the research questions, objectives, methodology, and other sections of the specified literature review.
3.  **Assess Current Research State:** Review any existing literature, search results, or research materials to understand current progress and available resources.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Literature Review Tasks:** Based on the literature review analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level literature review tasks required to complete the project. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level literature review tasks based on the literature review document. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Literature Review Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task, cover the literature review details implied by the document, and consider existing research resources where relevant without being constrained by them.
7.  **Identify Relevant Literature Review Files:** Based on the tasks and literature review document, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Literature Review Files` section, including corresponding literature notes or data files if applicable.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
9.  **Save Literature Review Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/literature-review/` directory with the filename `tasks-[literature-review-file-name].md`, where `[literature-review-file-name]` matches the base name of the input literature review file (e.g., if the input was `0001-conduct-literature-review.md`, the output is `tasks-0001-conduct-literature-review.md`).

## Output Format

The generated literature review task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Literature Review Files

- `path/to/literature-notes.md` - Brief description of why this file is relevant (e.g., Contains notes from key papers on the research topic).
- `data/search-results.csv` - Search results from databases).
- `analysis/synthesis-tables.md` - Tables summarizing key findings).
- `writing/draft-introduction.md` - Draft of the introduction section).
- `references/bibliography.bib` - Bibliography file with all references).

### Notes

- Literature notes should be organized by theme or research question.
- Search results should be documented with search dates and databases used.
- Use appropriate tools for literature management (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley, citation managers).

## Literature Review Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Literature Review Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Literature review sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Literature review sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Literature Review Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Literature review sub-task description 2.1]
