# Rule: Defining a Data Analysis Plan

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive data analysis plan that outlines the systematic approach to processing, analyzing, and interpreting research data.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides research data, analysis requirements, or existing research findings that need systematic analysis.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are common areas for data analysis planning:

*   **Data Sources:** "What are the sources and formats of the data to be analyzed?"
*   **Research Questions:** "What specific research questions will the data analysis address?"
*   **Analysis Objectives:** "What are the main objectives of the data analysis?"
*   **Data Types:** "What types of data are involved (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods)?"
*   **Statistical Methods:** "What statistical tests or analytical techniques will be used?"
*   **Software Tools:** "What software or programming languages will be used for analysis?"
*   **Quality Control:** "What quality control measures will be implemented during data processing?"
*   **Validation Methods:** "How will the analysis results be validated?"
*   **Output Requirements:** "What specific outputs or visualizations are needed?"
*   **Reproducibility:** "What steps will be taken to ensure the analysis is reproducible?"
*   **Ethical Considerations:** "Are there any ethical considerations in handling or analyzing this data?"
*   **Interpretation Framework:** "How will the analysis results be interpreted in the context of the research questions?"
*   **Assumptions:** "What assumptions are being made about the data?"

## Data Analysis Plan Structure

The generated data analysis plan should include:

1.  **Analysis Overview:** Summary of data sources, research questions, and expected insights.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Steps for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.
3.  **Analytical Methods:** Detailed description of statistical tests, models, or analytical approaches.
4.  **Quality Assurance:** Procedures for ensuring data quality and analysis validity.
5.  **Output Specifications:** Description of required analysis outputs, tables, and figures.
6.  **Validation Procedures:** Methods for verifying analysis accuracy and reliability.
7.  **Timeline:** Schedule for completing different analysis phases.
8.  **Resource Requirements:** Software, computational resources, and expertise needed.
9.  **Documentation Standards:** Requirements for documenting the analysis process and results.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary users are **data analysts, researchers, and statisticians**. Therefore, the plan should be technically precise, methodologically sound, and focused on producing valid and interpretable results.

## Data Analysis Standards

- Follow statistical best practices and methodological rigor.
- Ensure transparency and reproducibility of all analytical steps.
- Include appropriate data visualization techniques for effective communication of findings.

## Technical Requirements

- Specify data formats, file structures, and naming conventions.
- Include data backup and version control procedures.
- Consider computational efficiency and scalability for large datasets.
- Include sensitivity analyses or robustness checks where appropriate.
