# LLM Workflow Review Summary

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the review and standardization of the experiment-design workflow to ensure consistency with all other workflows in the research-workflow-blueprint repository.

**Status:** ✅ Complete - All workflows now follow consistent LLM-specific patterns

## What Was Reviewed

All 12 research workflows in the repository:
- ✅ data-analysis
- ✅ data-management
- ✅ **experiment-design** (Updated)
- ✅ grant-proposals
- ✅ literature-review
- ✅ paper-writing
- ✅ peer-review
- ✅ presentation-prep
- ✅ research-ethics
- ✅ research-project-management
- ✅ research-proposal
- ✅ thesis-writing

## Issues Found

The **experiment-design** workflow was the only workflow not following the standardized LLM-specific pattern used by all other workflows.

### Specific Issues

1. **Step 1 (create-experiment-protocol.md)**
   - Used generic "Overview" instead of "Rule:" format
   - Missing Goal and Process sections
   - Missing Clarifying Questions for AI guidance
   - Missing Output specifications
   - Missing Target Audience section

2. **Step 2 (generate-experiment-tasks.md)**
   - Used generic "Overview" instead of "Rule:" format
   - Missing standardized Output Format template
   - Missing Target Audience section

3. **Step 3 (process-experiment-task-list.md)**
   - 181 lines of generic project management content
   - Missing LLM-specific Task Implementation protocol
   - Missing "one sub-task at a time" guidance
   - Missing explicit AI Instructions section
   - Missing Completion Protocol with validation steps
   - No human-in-the-loop approval process

## Changes Made

### Step 1: create-experiment-protocol.md
**Before:** 143 lines with generic overview
**After:** 186 lines with LLM-specific guidance

**Added:**
- "Rule:" format header
- Goal section defining AI's objective
- Process section with step-by-step workflow
- Clarifying Questions section (12 example questions)
- Target Audience section
- Output specifications (format, location, filename)
- Final Instructions and Example Workflow

### Step 2: generate-experiment-tasks.md
**Before:** 128 lines with generic overview
**After:** 138 lines with standardized structure

**Added:**
- "Rule:" format header
- Goal section defining AI's objective
- Process section (8-step workflow)
- Output Format section with task list template
- Target Audience section

**Improved:**
- Restructured content to match standard pattern
- Removed redundant task generation template

### Step 3: process-experiment-task-list.md
**Before:** 181 lines of generic project management
**After:** 66 lines of focused LLM workflow guidance

**Added:**
- Experiment Task Implementation protocol
- "One experiment sub-task at a time" guidance
- Completion Protocol with validation steps
- Experiment Task List Maintenance guidelines
- AI Instructions section
- Experiment-Specific Considerations
- Experiment Quality Assurance
- Experiment Process Guidelines

**Removed:**
- Generic project management content
- Redundant templates and boilerplate
- Non-LLM-specific sections

## Standard Workflow Pattern

All 12 workflows now follow this consistent pattern:

### Step 1 Files (Planning - Create/Define/Conduct)
✅ "Rule:" format header
✅ Goal section
✅ Process section
✅ Clarifying Questions section
✅ Output specifications
✅ Target Audience section
✅ Final Instructions

### Step 2 Files (Task Generation)
✅ "Rule:" format header
✅ Goal section
✅ Process section (with Phase 1/Phase 2)
✅ Output Format section with template
✅ Target Audience section

### Step 3 Files (Task Processing)
✅ Task Implementation protocol (one at a time)
✅ Completion Protocol (validate, organize, document)
✅ Task List Maintenance guidelines
✅ AI Instructions section
✅ Domain-Specific Considerations
✅ Quality Assurance section
✅ Process Guidelines (optional)

## Benefits

### 1. Consistency
- All workflows use identical structure and terminology
- Easier for users to switch between different research tasks
- Predictable AI behavior across all domains

### 2. Quality Control
- Human-in-the-loop approval for each sub-task
- Validation steps before marking tasks complete
- Explicit quality assurance guidelines

### 3. Clear AI Guidance
- AI knows exactly what to do at each step
- "One sub-task at a time" prevents AI from getting ahead
- Clarifying Questions ensure proper understanding

### 4. Better Documentation
- Standardized output formats
- Clear file naming conventions
- Proper task list maintenance

### 5. Improved User Experience
- Reduced complexity (66 vs 181 lines in step 3)
- Clearer instructions
- Better progress tracking

## Validation Results

All required sections present:

**Step 1 (create-experiment-protocol.md):**
- ✅ Has Rule: header
- ✅ Has Goal section
- ✅ Has Process section
- ✅ Has Clarifying Questions
- ✅ Has Output section
- ✅ Has Target Audience

**Step 2 (generate-experiment-tasks.md):**
- ✅ Has Rule: header
- ✅ Has Goal section
- ✅ Has Process section
- ✅ Has Output Format
- ✅ Has Target Audience

**Step 3 (process-experiment-task-list.md):**
- ✅ Has Task Implementation
- ✅ Has Completion Protocol
- ✅ Has Task List Maintenance
- ✅ Has AI Instructions
- ✅ Has Specific Considerations
- ✅ Has Quality Assurance
- ✅ Has one-at-a-time protocol

## Optional Future Enhancements

While the core 3-step workflow is now complete and consistent, consider these optional additions:

1. **Cross-Workflow Integration Guide** - How to combine workflows (e.g., experiment → analysis → paper)
2. **Example Task Lists** - Sample completed task lists for each workflow
3. **AI Model-Specific Tips** - Guidance for different AI models if behavior differs
4. **Troubleshooting Guide** - Common issues and solutions
5. **Workflow Selection Guide** - Decision tree to help choose the right workflow
6. **Version Control Best Practices** - Detailed git guidance for AI-generated content

## Conclusion

✅ **All workflows are now fully standardized and consistent**

The experiment-design workflow has been successfully updated to match the LLM-specific pattern used by all other workflows in the repository. No additional changes are required for the core 3-step workflow structure.

All 12 research workflows now provide:
- Consistent structure and terminology
- Proper AI guidance and instructions
- Human-in-the-loop quality control
- Clear documentation and output specifications
- Domain-specific considerations and quality assurance
