# Rule: Creating a Research Project Management Plan

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive research project management plan that coordinates all aspects of the research lifecycle, from initial proposal through final publication and dissemination.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides research objectives, existing proposals, or ongoing projects that need systematic management and coordination.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are common areas for research project management:

*   **Project Scope:** "What is the overall scope and timeline of this research project?"
*   **Research Components:** "What are the main components of this research project (e.g., literature review, data collection, analysis, writing)?"
*   **Team Members:** "Are there multiple researchers or collaborators involved in this project?"
*   **Milestones:** "What are the key milestones and deliverables?"
*   **Resources:** "What resources (e.g., funding, equipment, software) are available or needed?"
*   **Timeline:** "What is the overall project timeline and deadlines?"
*   **Risk Management:** "What potential risks or challenges might affect the project timeline?"
*   **Communication:** "What communication channels and frequency are needed for team coordination?"
*   **Documentation:** "What documentation and reporting requirements exist for this project?"
*   **Integration Points:** "How do different research components (literature review, data analysis, paper writing) need to be coordinated?"
*   **Quality Assurance:** "What quality control measures and review processes should be implemented?"
*   **Dissemination:** "What are the plans for disseminating research findings (e.g., publications, presentations, reports)?"

## Research Project Management Plan Structure

The generated research project management plan should include:

1.  **Project Overview:** Summary of research objectives, scope, and expected outcomes.
2.  **Project Timeline:** Overall schedule with key milestones and deadlines.
3.  **Resource Allocation:** Budget, personnel, and equipment planning.
4.  **Risk Assessment:** Identification and mitigation strategies for potential project risks.
5.  **Team Structure:** Roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols.
6.  **Component Coordination:** How different research activities will be integrated and synchronized.
7.  **Progress Tracking:** Methods for monitoring project advancement and identifying potential delays.
8.  **Communication Plan:** Meeting schedules, progress reporting, and collaboration tools.
9.  **Quality Management:** Standards, review processes, and validation procedures.
10. **Reporting Requirements:** Documentation standards and deliverable specifications.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary users are **research project managers, principal investigators, and team leaders**. Therefore, the plan should be practical, actionable, and focused on coordination and delivery.

## Research Project Management Standards

- Follow project management best practices (e.g., PMBOK, Agile methodologies).
- Include contingency planning for potential delays or obstacles.
- Specify clear deliverables and success criteria for each project phase.
- Include mechanisms for regular progress assessment and course correction.
- Consider both short-term deliverables and long-term research goals.
- Ensure alignment between research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.
