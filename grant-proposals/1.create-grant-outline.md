# Rule: Creating a Grant Proposal Outline for Funding Applications

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive grant proposal outline in Markdown format, based on project descriptions, research findings, or existing proposals. The outline should provide a clear structure for writing a competitive grant application suitable for submission to funding agencies.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a project description, research findings, or request for grant writing assistance.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are common areas to explore for grant proposals:

*   **Funding Agency:** "Which funding agency or foundation are you applying to?"
*   **Grant Type:** "What type of grant is this (e.g., research grant, program grant, capacity building)?"
*   **Project Scope:** "What is the scope and duration of the proposed project?"
*   **Budget Requirements:** "What is the total funding amount requested and what are the major budget categories?"
*   **Deadline:** "What is the submission deadline for this grant application?"
*   **Required Documents:** "What specific documents or sections are required by the funding agency?"
*   **Evaluation Criteria:** "What are the key evaluation criteria for this grant?"
*   **Target Audience:** "Who is the primary audience or beneficiaries of this project?"
*   **Innovation Elements:** "What are the innovative aspects of this project that should be highlighted?"
*   **Team Composition:** "Who are the key personnel involved in this project?"
*   **Partnerships:** "Are there any collaborators, partners, or subcontractors involved?"
*   **Reporting Requirements:** "What are the reporting and evaluation requirements?"
*   **Previous Work:** "Do you have existing project descriptions, research proposals, or preliminary data to incorporate?"

## Grant Proposal Outline Structure

The generated grant proposal outline should include the following sections:

1.  **Title:** A clear, concise title that reflects the project's goals and significance.
2.  **Executive Summary:** Brief overview of the project, objectives, and funding request.
3.  **Problem Statement & Significance:** Clear articulation of the problem being addressed and why it matters.
4.  **Project Goals & Objectives:** Long-term vision and specific, measurable objectives.
5.  **Methodology & Approach:** Detailed description of project implementation and research methods.
6.  **Timeline & Milestones:** Project phases, key milestones, and deliverables.
7.  **Budget & Justification:** Comprehensive budget with detailed cost justification.
8.  **Evaluation & Dissemination:** Plan for assessing project success and sharing results.
9.  **Team & Organization:** Qualifications of key personnel and institutional capacity.
10. **Sustainability & Future Directions:** Plan for project continuation beyond funding period.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the grant proposal outline is a **researcher, project manager, or grant writer** seeking funding for their work. Therefore, the outline should follow standard grant proposal formats and include all elements typically required by funding agencies.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `/grant-proposals/`
*   **Filename:** `[n]-outline-[project-topic].md` (Where `n` is a zero-padded 4-digit sequence starting from 0001, e.g., `0001-outline-healthcare-innovation.md`, `0002-outline-education-reform.md`, etc.)
