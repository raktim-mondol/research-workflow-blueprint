# Rule: Creating a Thesis/Dissertation Outline for Academic Research

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive thesis/dissertation outline in Markdown format, based on research findings, literature reviews, and existing research proposals. The outline should provide a clear structure for writing a complete academic thesis or dissertation suitable for degree completion.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides research findings, a completed literature review, or a research proposal that needs to be developed into a full thesis or dissertation.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are common areas to explore for thesis/dissertation writing:

*   **Degree Level:** "What degree level is this thesis/dissertation for (e.g., Master's, PhD)?"
*   **Department Requirements:** "What are the specific formatting and content requirements from your department or university?"
*   **Research Methodology:** "What research methodology did you use (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, mixed-methods)?"
*   **Institutional Guidelines:** "Are there specific institutional guidelines or templates you need to follow?"
*   **Thesis Type:** "Is this an empirical study, theoretical analysis, or systematic review?"
*   **Committee Members:** "Who are your committee members and do they have specific expectations?"
*   **Key Contributions:** "What are the main contributions or original aspects of your research?"
*   **Existing Materials:** "Do you have existing research proposals, literature reviews, or preliminary data to incorporate?"
*   **Defense Timeline:** "What is your target defense date or submission deadline?"
*   **Chapter Structure:** "What is the required chapter structure for your institution?"
*   **Timeline:** "Do you have specific milestones or deadlines for completing chapters?"
*   **Previous Work:** "Do you have existing drafts, literature reviews, or research proposals to incorporate?"
*   **Data Collection:** "What data have you collected and how will it be presented?"
*   **Publication Plans:** "Do you plan to publish parts of your thesis as journal articles?"

## Thesis/Dissertation Outline Structure

The generated thesis/dissertation outline should include the following sections:

1.  **Title Page:** Complete title, author, institution, degree, and date.
2.  **Abstract:** Brief summary of the research problem, methods, findings, and conclusions.
3.  **Table of Contents:** Complete listing of all chapters, sections, and subsections.
4.  **Introduction Chapter:** Background, problem statement, research questions, and thesis structure overview.
5.  **Literature Review Chapter:** Comprehensive synthesis of relevant literature and theoretical frameworks.
6.  **Methodology Chapter:** Detailed description of research design, data collection, and analysis methods.
7.  **Results/Findings Chapters:** Presentation of research results, data analysis, and key findings.
8.  **Discussion Chapter:** Interpretation of results, implications, limitations, and relation to existing work.
9.  **Conclusion Chapter:** Summary of main findings, contributions to knowledge, and future research directions.
10. **References/Bibliography:** Complete list of cited works in required format.
11. **Appendices (if needed):** Supplementary materials, data, or detailed methods.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the thesis/dissertation outline is a **graduate student or researcher** working on their thesis or dissertation. Therefore, the outline should follow academic writing conventions and institutional requirements for thesis/dissertation writing.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `/thesis-writing/`
*   **Filename:** `[n]-outline-[thesis-topic].md` (Where `n` is a zero-padded 4-digit sequence starting from 0001, e.g., `0001-outline-machine-learning-applications.md`, `0002-outline-systematic-review-healthcare.md`, etc.)

## Thesis Writing Standards

- Follow institutional guidelines for thesis/dissertation structure
- Include appropriate subsections for each chapter
- Specify key points, arguments, or data to include in each section.
- Consider specific requirements for chapter length, formatting, and content
- Ensure logical flow and coherence between chapters
- Include notes on required elements like acknowledgments, declaration, or ethical statements.
- Maintain academic rigor and scholarly tone throughout
- Include proper citation style and reference formatting
