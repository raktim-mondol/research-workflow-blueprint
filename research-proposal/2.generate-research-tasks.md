# Rule: Generating a Research Task List from a Research Proposal

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step research task list in Markdown format based on an existing Research Proposal Document. The task list should guide a researcher through the systematic implementation of their research project.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/research/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[proposal-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-0001-proposal-machine-learning-applications.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive Proposal Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific research proposal file
2.  **Analyze Research Proposal:** The AI reads and analyzes the research questions, objectives, methodology, and other sections of the specified proposal.
3.  **Assess Current Research State:** Review any existing literature, data, or research materials to understand current progress and available resources.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Research Tasks:** Based on the proposal analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level research tasks required to complete the project. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about five tasks. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level research tasks based on the proposal. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Research Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task, cover the research details implied by the proposal, and consider existing research resources where relevant without being constrained by them.
7.  **Identify Relevant Research Files:** Based on the tasks and proposal, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Research Files` section, including corresponding literature notes or data files if applicable.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
9.  **Save Research Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/research/` directory with the filename `tasks-[proposal-file-name].md`, where `[proposal-file-name]` matches the base name of the input proposal file (e.g., if the input was `0001-proposal-machine-learning-applications.md`, the output is `tasks-0001-proposal-machine-learning-applications.md`).

## Output Format

The generated research task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Research Files

- `path/to/literature-notes.md` - Brief description of why this file is relevant (e.g., Contains notes from key papers on machine learning applications).
- `data/raw/collected-data.csv` - Raw data collected for analysis).
- `analysis/statistical-analysis.R` - Script for statistical analysis).
- `writing/draft-introduction.md` - Draft of the introduction section).
- `references/bibliography.bib` - Bibliography file with all references).

### Notes

- Literature notes should be organized by theme or research question.
- Data files should follow FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
- Use appropriate tools for data analysis (e.g., R, Python, SPSS) as specified in the methodology.

## Research Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Research Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Research sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Research sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Research Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Research sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Research Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely organizational or preparatory)
```

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed research sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level research plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the research task list is a **researcher or student** who will implement the research project with awareness of the academic context.

## Final Instructions

- Ensure tasks are specific, measurable, and actionable for academic research.
- Consider the research methodology (systematic review, empirical study, etc.) when breaking down tasks.
- Include tasks for literature search, data collection, analysis, and writing.
- Adapt the task breakdown based on the complexity and scope of the research project.
