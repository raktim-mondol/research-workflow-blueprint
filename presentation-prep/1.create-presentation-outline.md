# Rule: Creating a Conference Presentation Outline

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive presentation outline for academic conferences, based on research findings, completed papers, or existing research materials.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides research findings, a completed paper, or presentation requirements for a specific conference.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are common areas for conference presentations:

*   **Presentation Type:** "What type of presentation is this (e.g., oral presentation, poster session, keynote)?"
*   **Target Conference:** "Which conference are you presenting at and what are their specific requirements?"
*   **Audience:** "Who is the primary audience for this presentation (e.g., specialists, general academic audience)?"
*   **Time Allocation:** "How much time is allocated for the presentation?"
*   **Key Messages:** "What are the main takeaway messages you want the audience to remember?"
*   **Visualization Needs:** "What types of visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs, diagrams) are needed?"
*   **Technical Requirements:** "Are there specific technical requirements (e.g., slide format, aspect ratio, file size limitations)?"
*   **Interactive Elements:** "Will there be opportunities for audience questions or discussion?"
*   **Practice Requirements:** "Do you need assistance with presentation practice or timing?"
*   **Handout Materials:** "Are there any supplementary materials or handouts needed?"
*   **Previous Presentations:** "Do you have existing slides or presentation materials to incorporate?"

## Presentation Outline Structure

The generated presentation outline should include:

1.  **Presentation Title:** Clear, engaging title that reflects the content.
2.  **Presenter Information:** Name, affiliation, and contact details.
3.  **Abstract/Summary:** Brief overview of the presentation content.
4.  **Introduction:** Background, problem statement, and presentation objectives.
5.  **Methodology Overview:** Brief description of research methods (if relevant).
6.  **Key Findings/Results:** Main research outcomes to be presented.
7.  **Discussion/Implications:** Interpretation of findings and their significance.
8.  **Conclusion:** Summary of key points and future directions.
9.  **Q&A Preparation:** Anticipated questions and prepared responses.
10. **References/Acknowledgments:** Key references and acknowledgments.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary audience is **academic conference attendees**. Therefore, the presentation should be engaging, well-structured, and focused on communicating key insights effectively.

## Presentation Standards

- Follow academic presentation best practices for clarity and engagement.
- Include appropriate visual aids and supporting materials.
- Consider time management and pacing for effective delivery.

## Visual Design Guidelines

- Use clear, readable fonts and appropriate color schemes.
- Limit text on slides to key points and use visualizations to enhance understanding.
- Ensure consistency in design elements throughout the presentation.
- Include speaker notes or talking points for each slide.

## Time Management

- Allocate appropriate time for each section based on the total presentation duration.
- Include buffer time for transitions and potential audience interactions.
