# Rule: Generating a Research Data Management Task List from a Data Management Plan

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step data management task list in Markdown format based on an existing Data Management Plan Document. The task list should guide a researcher through the systematic implementation of their data management strategy.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/data-management/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[data-plan-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-climate-change-data-plan.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive Data Plan Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific data management plan file
2.  **Analyze Data Management Plan Document:** The AI reads and analyzes the data management structure, requirements, policies, and implementation details.
3.  **Assess Current Data Management State:** Review any existing data documentation, storage solutions, or management tools to understand current progress and available infrastructure.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Data Management Tasks:** Based on the plan analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level data management tasks required to implement the plan. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about five tasks. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level data management tasks based on the plan. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Data Management Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task, cover the management details implied by the plan, and consider existing data infrastructure where relevant without being constrained by it.
7.  **Identify Relevant Data Management Files:** Based on the tasks and plan, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Data Management Files` section, including corresponding documentation, configuration files, or data files if applicable.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
9.  **Save Data Management Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/data-management/` directory with the filename `tasks-[data-plan-file-name].md`, where `[data-plan-file-name]` matches the base name of the input data management plan file (e.g., if the input was `climate-change-data-plan.md`, the output is `tasks-climate-change-data-plan.md`).

## Output Format

The generated data management task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Data Management Files

- `data-management-plan.md` - Complete data management plan document.
- `metadata-templates/` - Standardized metadata templates for different data types.
- `data-documentation/` - Comprehensive documentation for datasets.
- `backup-procedures.md` - Documented backup and recovery procedures.
- `access-control-policies.md` - Data access and sharing policies.
- `data-inventory.csv` - Inventory of all datasets with key metadata.
- `repository-configuration/` - Configuration files for data repositories.

### Notes

- Data documentation should follow disciplinary standards and funder requirements.
- Storage solutions should address security, accessibility, and preservation needs.
- Use appropriate data management tools and platforms (e.g., Git, cloud storage, repository systems).
