# Experiment Protocol Creation

## Overview
This document outlines the process for creating a comprehensive experiment protocol that includes all necessary components for scientific experimentation.

## Protocol Components

### 1. Research Question & Hypothesis
- **Primary Research Question**: Clearly state the main question being investigated
- **Hypotheses**: Formulate testable hypotheses (null and alternative)
- **Objectives**: Define specific, measurable objectives

### 2. Experimental Design
- **Design Type**: Randomized controlled trial, factorial design, etc.
- **Variables**: Independent, dependent, control variables
- **Sample Size & Power Analysis**: Justify sample size with statistical power calculations

### 3. Materials & Methods
- **Materials List**: Complete inventory of required equipment and supplies
- **Experimental Setup**: Detailed description of apparatus and configuration
- **Procedure**: Step-by-step experimental procedure

### 4. Data Collection
- **Measurement Instruments**: Specifications of tools and instruments
- **Data Recording**: Methods for data capture and storage
- **Quality Control**: Procedures to ensure data integrity

### 5. Statistical Analysis Plan
- **Primary Analysis**: Main statistical tests for hypothesis testing
- **Secondary Analysis**: Additional exploratory analyses
- **Data Processing**: Methods for data cleaning and transformation

### 6. Ethical Considerations
- **Informed Consent**: Process for obtaining participant consent
- **Safety Protocols**: Measures to ensure participant and researcher safety
- **Data Privacy**: Protocols for handling sensitive information

### 7. Timeline & Resources
- **Experimental Timeline**: Schedule for all experimental phases
- **Resource Allocation**: Budget and personnel requirements

## Best Practices

### Protocol Development
- Start with a clear research question
- Ensure hypotheses are testable and falsifiable
- Include sufficient detail for replication
- Consider potential confounding factors
- Plan for data quality assurance

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Include all necessary technical specifications
- Document potential limitations and mitigation strategies
- Specify data management and storage protocols

### Review Process
- Peer review of protocol
- Pilot testing of procedures
- Validation of measurement instruments

## Next Steps

After completing the experiment protocol:
1. Review protocol with stakeholders
2. Conduct pilot study if applicable
3. Refine procedures based on pilot results
4. Proceed to task generation in `2.generate-experiment-tasks.md`
