# Rule: Creating a Paper Outline for Journal/Conference Publication

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive paper outline in Markdown format, based on research findings, literature reviews, and existing research proposals. The outline should provide a clear structure for writing a complete academic paper suitable for journal or conference submission.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides research findings, a completed literature review, or a research proposal that needs to be developed into a full paper.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before creating the outline, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to understand the paper's scope, target venue, and key contributions.
3.  **Generate Paper Outline:** Based on the initial prompt and the user's answers to the clarifying questions, generate a paper outline using the structure outlined below.
4.  **Save Paper Outline:** Save the generated document as `[n]-outline-[paper-topic].md` inside the `/paper-writing/` directory. (Where `n` is a zero-padded 4-digit sequence starting from 0001, e.g., `0001-outline-machine-learning-applications.md`, `0002-outline-systematic-review-healthcare.md`, etc.)

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are common areas to explore for academic paper writing:

*   **Paper Type:** "What type of paper is this (e.g., research article, review paper, case study, methodology paper)?"
*   **Target Venue:** "Which journal or conference are you targeting for submission?"
*   **Key Contributions:** "What are the main contributions or novel aspects of this paper?"
*   **Target Audience:** "Who is the primary audience for this paper (e.g., researchers, practitioners, policymakers)?"
*   **Paper Structure:** "Do you have specific section requirements from the target venue?"
*   **Research Findings:** "What are the key research findings or results that need to be presented?"
*   **Methodology:** "What research methods were used and need to be described?"
*   **Data/Evidence:** "What data, evidence, or examples will support your arguments?"
*   **Length Requirements:** "Are there specific word count or page limit requirements?"
*   **Citation Style:** "What citation style is required by the target venue?"
*   **Timeline:** "Do you have submission deadlines or timeline constraints?"
*   **Co-authors:** "Are there other authors who need to review or contribute to sections?"
*   **Previous Work:** "Do you have existing drafts, literature reviews, or research proposals to incorporate?"

## Paper Outline Structure

The generated paper outline should include the following sections:

1.  **Title:** A clear, concise title that reflects the paper's content and contributions.
2.  **Authors and Affiliations:** List of authors and their institutional affiliations.
3.  **Abstract:** Brief summary of the paper's purpose, methods, results, and conclusions.
4.  **Introduction:** Background, problem statement, research questions, and paper structure overview.
5.  **Literature Review/Related Work:** Synthesis of relevant literature and positioning of the paper's contributions.
6.  **Methodology:** Detailed description of research design, data collection, and analysis methods.
7.  **Results/Findings:** Presentation of research results, data analysis, or key findings.
8.  **Discussion:** Interpretation of results, implications, limitations, and relation to existing work.
9.  **Conclusion:** Summary of main findings, contributions to knowledge, and future research directions.
10. **References:** Complete list of cited works in required format.
11. **Appendices (if needed):** Supplementary materials, data, or detailed methods.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the paper outline is a **researcher or academic writer**. Therefore, the outline should be structured according to to academic writing conventions and follow standard paper formats for the target venue.

## Paper Writing Standards

- Follow IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) structure for research papers.
- Include appropriate subsections for each major section.
- Specify key points, arguments, or data to include in each section.
- Consider the specific requirements and guidelines of the target journal or conference.
- Ensure logical flow and coherence between sections.
- Include notes on required elements like keywords, acknowledgments, or ethical statements.
