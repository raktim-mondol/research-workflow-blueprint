# Experiment Task List Management

Guidelines for managing experiment task lists in markdown files to track progress on executing experimental protocols and collecting research data.

## Experiment Task Implementation
- **One experiment sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next experiment sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish an **experiment sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** experiment subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Validate the experiment work completed (check protocol adherence, verify data quality, ensure proper documentation, etc.)
    - **Only if all experiment validation passes**: Organize experiment materials and update documentation
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary experiment notes and organize final files
    - **Document Progress**: Use a descriptive experiment progress update that:
      - Uses scientific writing format
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent experiment task
    - Lists key experimental milestones, data collected, or protocol refinements
    - References the experiment task number and research context
  3. Once all the experiment subtasks are marked completed and work has been organized, mark the **parent experiment task** as completed.
- Stop after each experiment sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Experiment Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the experiment task list as you work:**
   - Mark experiment tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new experiment tasks as they emerge during the experimental process.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Experiment Files" section:**
   - List every experiment file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its experimental purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with experiment task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the experiment task list file after finishing any significant experimental work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **experiment sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent experiment task** `[x]` once **all** its experiment subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered experiment tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Experiment Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting experiment work, check which experiment sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing an experiment sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.

## Experiment-Specific Considerations

- **Protocol Adherence Tasks:** Include execution of experimental procedures exactly as specified in the protocol.
- **Data Collection Tasks:** Ensure systematic data recording and proper measurement documentation.
- **Equipment Management Tasks:** Follow calibration, maintenance, and quality control procedures.
- **Safety Compliance Tasks:** Adhere to all safety protocols and ethical guidelines.
- **Validation:** Check for experimental rigor, proper controls, and adherence to scientific standards.
- **Documentation:** Maintain detailed experimental logs for reproducibility and transparency.

## Experiment Quality Assurance

- **Protocol Compliance:** Ensure all procedures follow the approved experimental protocol.
- **Data Integrity:** Verify accuracy of measurements and proper data recording.
- **Equipment Calibration:** Check that all instruments are properly calibrated and functioning.
- **Safety Standards:** Confirm adherence to all safety and ethical requirements.
- **Documentation Completeness:** Ensure all experimental procedures and observations are properly documented.

## Experiment Process Guidelines

- **Preparation Phase:** Focus on protocol finalization, materials procurement, and setup validation.
- **Execution Phase:** Conduct experiments systematically with proper data collection and quality control.
- **Analysis Phase:** Process data, perform statistical analyses, and interpret results.
- **Documentation Phase:** Compile results, prepare reports, and archive all experimental data.
- **Review Process:** Include peer review of procedures, pilot testing, and validation of methods.
