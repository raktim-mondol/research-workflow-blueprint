# Rule: Creating an Experiment Protocol

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive experiment protocol in Markdown format based on a research question, hypothesis, or existing research proposal. The protocol should provide all necessary components for conducting rigorous scientific experimentation.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a research question, hypothesis, or research proposal that requires an experimental protocol.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before creating the protocol, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to understand the experimental scope, design, and requirements.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are common areas for experiment protocol development:

*   **Research Question:** "What is the specific research question or hypothesis you are testing?"
*   **Experimental Design:** "What type of experimental design are you considering (e.g., randomized controlled trial, factorial design, crossover design)?"
*   **Variables:** "What are the independent, dependent, and control variables in your experiment?"
*   **Sample Size:** "Do you have specific sample size requirements or power analysis considerations?"
*   **Study Population:** "Who are the study participants or what are the experimental subjects?"
*   **Materials & Equipment:** "What specific materials, equipment, or instruments are required for this experiment?"
*   **Measurements:** "What measurements or data will you collect, and how will they be recorded?"
*   **Data Analysis:** "What statistical analyses or data processing methods do you plan to use?"
*   **Timeline:** "What is your timeline for completing the experiment?"
*   **Ethical Considerations:** "Are there any ethical considerations, safety protocols, or regulatory approvals required?"
*   **Resources:** "What budget and personnel resources are available for this experiment?"
*   **Prior Work:** "Do you have existing pilot data, preliminary studies, or related protocols to reference?"

## Protocol Components

### 1. Research Question & Hypothesis
- **Primary Research Question**: Clearly state the main question being investigated
- **Hypotheses**: Formulate testable hypotheses (null and alternative)
- **Objectives**: Define specific, measurable objectives

### 2. Experimental Design
- **Design Type**: Randomized controlled trial, factorial design, etc.
- **Variables**: Independent, dependent, control variables
- **Sample Size & Power Analysis**: Justify sample size with statistical power calculations

### 3. Materials & Methods
- **Materials List**: Complete inventory of required equipment and supplies
- **Experimental Setup**: Detailed description of apparatus and configuration
- **Procedure**: Step-by-step experimental procedure

### 4. Data Collection
- **Measurement Instruments**: Specifications of tools and instruments
- **Data Recording**: Methods for data capture and storage
- **Quality Control**: Procedures to ensure data integrity

### 5. Statistical Analysis Plan
- **Primary Analysis**: Main statistical tests for hypothesis testing
- **Secondary Analysis**: Additional exploratory analyses
- **Data Processing**: Methods for data cleaning and transformation

### 6. Ethical Considerations
- **Informed Consent**: Process for obtaining participant consent
- **Safety Protocols**: Measures to ensure participant and researcher safety
- **Data Privacy**: Protocols for handling sensitive information

### 7. Timeline & Resources
- **Experimental Timeline**: Schedule for all experimental phases
- **Resource Allocation**: Budget and personnel requirements

## Best Practices

### Protocol Development
- Start with a clear research question
- Ensure hypotheses are testable and falsifiable
- Include sufficient detail for replication
- Consider potential confounding factors
- Plan for data quality assurance

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Include all necessary technical specifications
- Document potential limitations and mitigation strategies
- Specify data management and storage protocols

### Review Process
- Peer review of protocol
- Pilot testing of procedures
- Validation of measurement instruments

## Target Audience

Assume the primary users are **researchers and experimentalists**. Therefore, the protocol should be technically precise, methodologically sound, and include sufficient detail for replication.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `/experiment-design/`
*   **Filename:** `[n]-protocol-[experiment-title].md` (e.g., `0001-protocol-behavioral-study.md`).

## Final Instructions

1. Ensure the experiment protocol is comprehensive and adheres to scientific standards.
2. Ask clarifying questions to refine the experimental design and approach.
3. Save the completed protocol in the specified directory.

## Example Workflow

- Use this file when the user requests an experiment protocol for a research study.
- Guide the AI through each step, pausing for user approval as needed.

## Next Steps

After completing the experiment protocol:
1. Review protocol with stakeholders
2. Conduct pilot study if applicable
3. Refine procedures based on pilot results
4. Proceed to task generation in `2.generate-experiment-tasks.md`
