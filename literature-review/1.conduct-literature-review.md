# Rule: Conducting a Comprehensive Literature Review

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in performing a systematic and thorough literature review based on a research question or topic. The review should follow academic standards for rigor, transparency, and reproducibility.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides a research question, topic, or existing research proposal for which a literature review is needed.
2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Before starting the literature review, the AI *must* ask clarifying questions to define the scope and methodology.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

The AI should adapt its questions based on the prompt, but here are common areas for literature reviews:

*   **Research Focus:** "What is the specific research question or topic you want to review?"
*   **Scope:** "What is the temporal scope (e.g., last 5 years, all years)?"
*   **Key Terms:** "What are the key search terms, synonyms, or related concepts?"
*   **Databases/Sources:** "Which academic databases or sources should be searched (e.g., PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar)?"
*   **Inclusion Criteria:** "What criteria should studies meet to be included (e.g., peer-reviewed, specific study designs, population)?"
*   **Exclusion Criteria:** "What types of studies should be excluded?"
*   **Objectives:** "What are the main objectives of this literature review?"
*   **Synthesis Method:** "How will you synthesize the findings (e.g., narrative synthesis, meta-analysis, thematic analysis)?"
*   **Quality Assessment:** "What tool or criteria will you use to assess study quality?"
*   **Output Format:** "What format should the literature review take (e.g., standalone document, section within a paper)?"
*   **Expected Output:** "What specific outputs are needed (e.g., annotated bibliography, summary tables, conceptual framework)?"
*   **Timeline:** "Do you have a timeline or deadlines for completing this review?"

## Literature Review Structure

The generated literature review document should include:

1.  **Introduction:** Background and rationale for the review.
2.  **Research Question:** Clearly stated question guiding the review.
3.  **Methods:** Detailed description of search strategy, study selection, data extraction, and synthesis.
4.  **Results:** Summary of included studies, key findings, and synthesis.
5.  **Discussion:** Interpretation of findings, limitations, and implications.
6.  **Conclusion:** Summary and future research directions.
7.  **References:** Complete list of included studies.

## Steps for Conducting the Literature Review

1.  **Define Search Strategy:**
    - Identify databases and search terms.
    - Develop search strings with Boolean operators.
2.  **Conduct Initial Search:** Perform searches across specified databases.
3.  **Screen Studies:** Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to titles and abstracts.
4.  **Full-Text Review:** Assess full texts of potentially relevant studies.
5.  **Data Extraction:** Extract relevant data from included studies.
6.  **Quality Assessment:** Evaluate study quality using appropriate tools.
7.  **Synthesize Findings:** Organize results thematically, chronologically, or by methodology.
8.  **Write Review:** Draft the literature review with proper academic structure.
9.  **Revise and Finalize:** Incorporate feedback and finalize the document.

## Output

*   **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
*   **Location:** `/research/`
*   **Filename:** `[n]-literature-review-[topic].md` (e.g., `0001-literature-review-machine-learning.md`).

## Final Instructions

1. Ensure the literature review is comprehensive and adheres to academic standards.
2. Ask clarifying questions to refine the scope and approach.
3. Save the completed literature review in the specified directory.

## Example Workflow

- Use this file when the user requests a literature review on a specific topic.
- Guide the AI through each step, pausing for user approval as needed.
