# Rule: Creating a Research Data Management Plan

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive research data management plan in Markdown format. The plan should outline how research data will be handled throughout the research lifecycle, from collection to preservation and sharing, ensuring compliance with funder requirements, institutional policies, and ethical standards.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides research project details, data types, and requirements that need to be addressed in a formal data management plan.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

*   **Research Project:** "What is the main research project or study that this data management plan will support?"
*   **Data Types:** "What types of data will be collected or generated (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, experimental, observational, simulations)?"
*   **Funder Requirements:** "Are there specific data management requirements from your funding agency or institution?"
*   **Data Volume:** "What is the expected volume of data and what are the storage requirements?"
*   **Data Sensitivity:** "Does the data contain sensitive, confidential, or personally identifiable information?"
*   **Data Collection Methods:** "What methods will be used for data collection and what formats will the data be in?"
*   **Ethical Considerations:** "Are there ethical approvals, consent forms, or data protection requirements to consider?"
*   **Data Sharing:** "What are the plans for data sharing, including any embargo periods or access restrictions?"
*   **Repository Selection:** "Are there preferred data repositories or archives for your discipline?"
*   **Metadata Standards:** "What metadata standards or documentation practices are required for your data?"
*   **Long-term Preservation:** "What are the requirements for long-term data preservation and retention periods?"
*   **Collaboration:** "Will multiple researchers or institutions be involved in data management?"
*   **Data Ownership:** "Who owns the data and what are the intellectual property considerations?"
*   **Data Analysis Workflow:** "What are the planned data analysis methods and what software/tools will be used?"
*   **Budget:** "Is there a budget allocated for data management activities?"

## Research Data Management Plan Structure

The generated data management plan should include the following sections:

1.  **Project Overview:** Research objectives, scope, and data context.
2.  **Data Collection & Description:** Types of data, collection methods, formats, and documentation.
3.  **Data Storage & Backup:** Storage solutions, backup procedures, and data security measures.
4.  **Data Documentation & Metadata:** Standards, formats, and practices for documenting data.
3.  **Data Access & Sharing:** Policies for data access, sharing timelines, and repository selection.
4.  **Ethical & Legal Compliance:** Data protection, privacy, consent, and intellectual property considerations.
5.  **Data Preservation & Retention:** Long-term preservation strategy and data retention periods.
6.  **Roles & Responsibilities:** Team members responsible for data management tasks.
7.  **Budget & Resources:** Costs associated with data management and available resources.
8.  **Implementation Timeline:** Schedule for data management activities throughout the research lifecycle.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the data management plan is a **researcher, data manager, or funding agency representative**. Therefore, the plan should follow standard data management planning frameworks and address all required elements for research compliance.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/data-management/`
- **Filename:** `[project-name]-data-plan.md` (e.g., `climate-change-data-plan.md`)
