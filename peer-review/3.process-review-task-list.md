# Peer Review Task List Management

Guidelines for managing peer review task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a thorough and constructive peer review.

## Peer Review Task Implementation
- **One review sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next review sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **review sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** review subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Validate the review work completed (check objectivity, verify constructive tone, ensure confidentiality, etc.)
    - **Only if all review validation passes**: Organize review materials and update documentation
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary review notes and organize final files
    - **Document Progress**: Use a descriptive review progress update that:
      - Uses academic review format
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent review task
    - Lists key evaluation criteria addressed, major comments prepared, or recommendations formulated
    - References the review task number and manuscript context
  3. Once all the review subtasks are marked completed and work has been organized, mark the **parent review task** as completed.
- Stop after each review sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Peer Review Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the review task list as you work:**
   - Mark review tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new review tasks as they emerge during the review process.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Review Files" section:**
   - List every review file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its review purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with peer review task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the review task list file after finishing any significant review work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **review sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent review task** `[x]` once **all** its review subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered review tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Review Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting review work, check which review sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a review sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
