# Rule: Generating Data Analysis Tasks from an Analysis Plan

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step data analysis task list based on an existing Data Analysis Plan.

## Process

1.  **Receive Analysis Plan Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific data analysis plan file.
2.  **Analyze Analysis Plan Document:** The AI reads and analyzes the data sources, analytical methods, and output requirements.
3.  **Assess Current Analysis State:** Review existing data, preliminary analyses, or analysis tools available.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Data Analysis Tasks:** Based on the analysis plan and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level data analysis tasks required to complete the analysis project.
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Present the high-level tasks to the user and wait for "Go" to proceed.
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Data Analysis Sub-Tasks:** Once confirmed, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary for systematic data analysis.
7.  **Identify Relevant Data Analysis Files:** Based on the tasks and analysis plan, identify potential data files, analysis scripts, and output documents needed.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and analytical notes into the final Markdown structure.

## Output Format

The generated data analysis task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Data Analysis Files

- `data/raw/` - Directory for raw, unprocessed data files.
- `scripts/data-cleaning.R` - Script for data preprocessing and cleaning.
- `analysis/statistical-tests.R` - Script for statistical analysis.
- `outputs/figures/` - Directory for generated visualizations.
- `results/analysis-report.md` - Comprehensive report of analysis findings.
- `documentation/analysis-protocol.md` - Detailed documentation of analytical procedures.
- `reports/summary-tables.md` - Tables summarizing key results.

### Notes

- Data analysis files should support reproducible research practices.
- Include version control for analysis scripts and data files.
- Ensure all analysis steps are properly documented and traceable.
