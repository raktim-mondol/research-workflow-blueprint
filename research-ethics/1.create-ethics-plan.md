# Rule: Creating a Research Ethics & Compliance Plan

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive research ethics and compliance plan in Markdown format. The plan should address ethical considerations, regulatory requirements, and compliance frameworks throughout the research lifecycle, ensuring protection of human subjects, data privacy, and adherence to institutional and legal standards.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user provides research project details, ethical considerations, and compliance requirements that need to be addressed in a formal ethics plan.

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

*   **Research Project:** "What is the main research project or study that this ethics plan will support?"
*   **Human Subjects:** "Does the research involve human participants, and if so, what are the specific ethical considerations?"
*   **Institutional Review:** "What institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee approvals are required?"
*   **Data Privacy & Protection:** "What types of personal, sensitive, or confidential data will be collected or processed?"
*   **Informed Consent:** "What are the requirements for informed consent processes and documentation?"
*   **Vulnerable Populations:** "Does the research involve vulnerable populations (children, prisoners, individuals with disabilities, etc.)?"
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** "What specific regulations, laws, or standards must be followed (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, Common Rule)?"
*   **Data Security:** "What security measures and protocols are required to protect participant data?"
*   **Confidentiality:** "What measures will be implemented to ensure participant confidentiality and data anonymization?"
*   **Risk Assessment:** "What are the potential risks to participants and how will they be mitigated?"
*   **Conflict of Interest:** "Are there any potential conflicts of interest that need to be disclosed and managed?"
*   **Data Sharing & Publication:** "What are the ethical considerations for data sharing, publication, and dissemination?"
*   **Monitoring & Reporting:** "What ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements exist for ethical compliance?"
*   **Training Requirements:** "What ethics training or certifications are required for research team members?"

## Research Ethics & Compliance Plan Structure

The generated ethics and compliance plan should include the following sections:

1.  **Project Overview:** Research objectives, scope, and ethical context.
2.  **Human Subjects Protection:** IRB requirements, informed consent procedures, and participant safeguards.
3.  **Data Privacy & Security:** Data protection measures, confidentiality protocols, and security requirements.
4.  **Regulatory Compliance:** Applicable laws, regulations, and institutional policies.
5.  **Risk Management:** Risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and emergency procedures.
5.  **Compliance Documentation:** Required forms, approvals, and compliance records.
6.  **Training & Certification:** Required ethics training for research team members.
7.  **Monitoring & Reporting:** Ongoing compliance monitoring and reporting procedures.
8.  **Implementation Timeline:** Schedule for ethics and compliance activities throughout the research lifecycle.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the ethics plan is a **researcher, ethics committee member, or institutional compliance officer**. Therefore, the plan should follow standard research ethics frameworks and address all required elements for regulatory compliance.
