# Paper Writing Task List Management

Guidelines for managing paper writing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing an academic paper for journal or conference submission.

## Paper Writing Task Implementation
- **One paper writing sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next paper writing sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **paper writing sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** paper writing subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Validate the writing work completed (check academic tone, verify citation format, ensure logical flow, etc.)
    - **Only if all writing validation passes**: Organize writing materials and update documentation
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary writing notes and organize final files
    - **Document Progress**: Use a descriptive writing progress update that:
      - Uses academic writing format
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent paper writing task
    - Lists key writing achievements, section completions, or content improvements
    - References the paper writing task number and paper context
  3. Once all the paper writing subtasks are marked completed and work has been organized, mark the **parent paper writing task** as completed.
- Stop after each paper writing sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Paper Writing Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the paper writing task list as you work:**
   - Mark paper writing tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new paper writing tasks as they emerge during the writing process.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Paper Writing Files" section:**
   - List every paper writing file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its writing purpose.

## AI Instructions

When working with paper writing task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the paper writing task list file after finishing any significant writing work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **paper writing sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent paper writing task** `[x]` once **all** its paper writing subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered paper writing tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Paper Writing Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting paper writing work, check which paper writing sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a paper writing sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.

## Paper Writing-Specific Considerations

- **Section Writing Tasks:** Include drafting, revising, and polishing each paper section.

## Paper Writing Quality Assurance

- **Citation Accuracy:** Verify all references are correctly formatted and complete.
- **Language Quality:** Check for grammar, spelling, and clarity of expression.
