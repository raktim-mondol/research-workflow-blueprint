# Rule: Generating a Grant Writing Task List from a Grant Proposal Outline

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step grant writing task list in Markdown format based on an existing Grant Proposal Outline Document. The task list should guide a grant writer through the systematic implementation of their grant proposal development project.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/grant-proposals/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[grant-outline-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-0001-outline-healthcare-innovation.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive Grant Outline Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific grant proposal outline file
2.  **Analyze Grant Proposal Outline:** The AI reads and analyzes the project goals, objectives, methodology, and other sections of the specified outline.
3.  **Assess Current Grant Writing State:** Review any existing project descriptions, research proposals, or preliminary data to understand current progress and available content.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Grant Writing Tasks:** Based on the outline analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level grant writing tasks required to complete the proposal. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about five tasks. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level grant writing tasks based on the outline. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Grant Writing Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task, cover the writing details implied by the outline, and consider existing writing materials where relevant without being constrained by them.
7.  **Identify Relevant Grant Writing Files:** Based on the tasks and outline, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Grant Writing Files` section, including corresponding drafts, figures, or supporting documents if applicable.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
9.  **Save Grant Writing Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/grant-proposals/` directory with the filename `tasks-[grant-outline-file-name].md`, where `[grant-outline-file-name]` matches the base name of the input grant outline file (e.g., if the input was `0001-outline-healthcare-innovation.md`, the output is `tasks-0001-outline-healthcare-innovation.md`).

## Output Format

The generated grant writing task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Grant Writing Files

- `drafts/executive-summary.md` - Draft of the executive summary section).
- `drafts/problem-statement.md` - Draft of the problem statement section).
- `budget/detailed-budget.xlsx` - Detailed budget spreadsheet).
- `supporting-documents/cvs/` - CVs and biosketches for key personnel).
- `supporting-documents/letters-of-support.md` - Letters of support and collaboration).
- `figures/project-timeline.png` - Visual timeline of project phases).

### Notes

- Writing drafts should be organized by grant proposal sections.
- Budget documents should follow funding agency requirements.
- Supporting documents should be properly formatted and complete.

## Grant Writing Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Grant Writing Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Grant writing sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Grant writing sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Grant Writing Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Grant writing sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Grant Writing Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely organizational or preparatory)
```

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed grant writing sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level grant writing plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the grant writing task list is a **grant writer, project manager, or principal investigator** who will implement the grant proposal development with awareness of funding agency requirements.

## Final Instructions

- Ensure tasks are specific, measurable, and actionable for grant proposal development.
- Consider the specific requirements of the funding agency when breaking down tasks.
- Include tasks for proposal drafting, budget development, supporting document preparation, and submission.
- Adapt the task breakdown based on the complexity and scope of the grant application.
