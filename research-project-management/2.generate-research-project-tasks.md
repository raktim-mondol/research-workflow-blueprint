# Rule: Generating Research Project Management Tasks from a Project Plan

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step research project management task list based on an existing Research Project Management Plan.

## Process

1.  **Receive Project Plan Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific research project management plan file.
2.  **Analyze Project Plan Document:** The AI reads and analyzes the project scope, timeline, resources, and coordination requirements.
3.  **Assess Current Project State:** Review existing research components, progress, and coordination needs.
4.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Project Management Tasks:** Based on the project plan analysis and current state assessment, create the file and generate the main, high-level project management tasks required to coordinate the entire research project.
5.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Present the high-level tasks to the user and wait for "Go" to proceed.
6.  **Phase 2: Generate Project Management Sub-Tasks:** Once confirmed, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary for project coordination.
7.  **Identify Relevant Project Management Files:** Based on the tasks and project plan, identify potential coordination files, progress trackers, and communication tools needed.
8.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and coordination notes into the final Markdown structure.

## Output Format

The generated research project management task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Research Project Management Files

- `project/timeline.md` - Overall project schedule and milestones.
- `project/resource-allocation.md` - Resource planning and allocation.
- `project/risk-register.md` - Risk assessment and mitigation tracking.
- `project/progress-reports/` - Directory for regular progress documentation.
- `project/meeting-minutes/` - Documentation of team coordination meetings.
- `project/deliverables/` - Directory for project deliverables.
- `project/communication-plan.md` - Team communication protocols and tools.

### Notes

- Project management files should support coordination across all research components.
- Include mechanisms for tracking interdependencies between different research activities.
- Ensure all coordination activities are documented and traceable.
