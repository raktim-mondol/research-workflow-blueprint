# Generate Experiment Tasks

## Overview
This document provides a systematic approach for breaking down the experiment protocol into actionable tasks that can be assigned and tracked.

## Task Generation Framework

### 1. Preparation Phase Tasks
- **Protocol Finalization**: Review and approve experiment protocol
- **Materials Procurement**: Order and verify all required equipment and supplies
- **Setup Validation**: Test and calibrate experimental apparatus

### 2. Execution Phase Tasks
- **Participant Recruitment**: Screen and enroll study participants
- **Data Collection**: Execute experimental procedures and record data
- **Quality Control**: Monitor data quality and protocol adherence

### 3. Analysis Phase Tasks
- **Data Processing**: Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform planned statistical tests
- **Data Interpretation**: Analyze results and draw conclusions

### 4. Documentation Phase Tasks
- **Results Compilation**: Organize and summarize experimental findings
- **Report Writing**: Prepare comprehensive experiment report

## Task Categories

### Administrative Tasks
- **Ethics Approval**: Submit and obtain necessary approvals
- **Budget Management**: Track expenses and resource utilization
- **Timeline Monitoring**: Ensure adherence to experimental schedule

### Technical Tasks
- **Equipment Operation**: Specific procedures for using instruments
- **Data Management**: Protocols for data storage and backup

## Task Specifications

### Task Attributes
- **Priority**: High, Medium, Low
- **Estimated Duration**: Time required for completion
- **Dependencies**: Tasks that must be completed first
- **Assigned To**: Responsible team member
- **Deadline**: Target completion date

### Quality Criteria
- **Completeness**: Task includes all necessary steps
- **Clarity**: Instructions are unambiguous
- **Measurability**: Completion criteria are clearly defined

## Automation Guidelines

### Task Generation Rules
- Break down complex procedures into discrete, manageable steps
- Include verification and validation steps
- Specify required resources and tools
- Define success criteria and acceptance standards

## Integration with Project Management

### Task Tracking
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include progress monitoring mechanisms
- Plan for contingency tasks

## Best Practices

### Task Design
- Ensure tasks are atomic and independent
- Include time estimates and resource requirements
- Specify deliverables and documentation requirements

### Risk Management
- Identify potential bottlenecks and delays
- Plan alternative approaches for critical tasks
- Include quality assurance checkpoints

## Next Steps

After generating the experiment tasks:
1. Review task list for completeness
2. Assign responsibilities and deadlines
3. Set up tracking system
4. Proceed to task processing in `3.process-experiment-task-list.md`
